USAGE:

PARAMETERS:
  --help:       display this help document.
  --input:      specify the camera device to use. The default is /dev/video0.
  --resolution: override your camera's default resolution. Must be width and
                height as numbers separated by an 'x', e.g. '640x480'. May not
                work reliably.
  --background: replace your camera background with an image. The default is
                to blur your existing background that your camera sees. Use the
                special value of 'greenscreen' to replace the background with a
                solid green colour so that you can cut yourself out of the image
                with chroma-key software such as is built-into OBS.
  --hologram:   overlay a Star Wars style hologram effect onto your likeness.
  --mirror:     flip the image.
